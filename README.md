# horiseon-refactor

## Description
This project entailed the code refactoring of the Horiseon services homepage. For this project, I restructured the page's existing code to make it more comprehensible for anyone viewing/working on it. This involved commenting, adding semantic HTML tags, eliminating redundant code, etc.
